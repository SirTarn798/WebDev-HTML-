            <h1>TARN's GAMES</h1> This is my video games pages. It's one of my favorite hobbies.<br>
            Unfortunately, my computer is not very promising for playing video games. <br>
            This bad boy has been with me for over 10 years now. <br> Eventhough, I've played a lot of games and I want to share it with you. <hr>

                    <p>Without a doubt, this game is a major success of all the <strong>4X</strong> games. When you playing this game, you will lose the sense of time. It is that good.</p>

                    <p>I had always hated turn-based games. It is so annoying that I havc to run into monsters continuously. I hate it.
                        <br>But this game is different. I absoloutely love this game with all of my heart. I wish I could erase my memory and play this game freshly again.
